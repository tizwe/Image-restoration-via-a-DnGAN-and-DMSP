Contains the .h5 files of our pretrained models. 

Because the models are too large for GitHub, they have to be manually downloaded

Remark: 
It is possible that their architecture varies a little bit from the one implementet.
This is due to the fact that the website we retrieve our data from, went down unexpectedly the day we wanted to do a final training and save our models. 
Hece we had to come back to an earlier version for which we cannot guarantee that it was trained as it would have been in the current implementation. 
However the differences should be very small if existend at all. 
In addition it has to be kept in mind that to stochastic nature of the models as well as the relative instablility of the DnGAN, 
results can vary even when trained again with the exact same setting.
